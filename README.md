# social-network-API
A social media startup backend API that uses a NoSQL database

## Overview

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.
